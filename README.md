### How to manage tasks?
We use Shortcut to manage tickets so we don't get any conflict(It's a suggestion if you have another good option please suggest it)

Open our [Shortcut Workspace]("https://app.shortcut.com/integration-bee/stories/space/5/everything") and create a story for any task/feature you want to add, if you want to add any comment on your/someone else story add it.

* Always `git pull` before you start making any changes.
* Put useful & readable comments on your commits.
* It is preferable to make a branch for any feature/edit that might cause conflicts.
* When you get a merge conflict review it carefully so we don't loose any code.
